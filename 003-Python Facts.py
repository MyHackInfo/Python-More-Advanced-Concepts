# 1. There is actually a poem written by Tim Peters named as THE ZEN OF PYTHON which can be read by just writing import this in the interpreter.

# 2. One can return multiple values in Python. Don’t believe ? See the below code snippet:

# 3. One can use an “else” clause with a “for” loop in Python. It’s a special type of syntax that executes only if the for loop exits naturally, without any break statements

# 4. In Python, everything is done by reference. It doesn’t support pointers.

# 5. Function Argument Unpacking is another awesome feature of Python. One can unpack a list or a dictionary as function arguments using * and ** respectively. This is commonly known as the Splat operator

# 6. Want to find the index inside a for loop? Wrap an iterable with ‘enumerate’ and it will yield the item along with its index.

# 7. One can chain comparison operators in Python answer= 1<x<10 is executable in Python

# 8. We can’t define Infinities right? But wait! Not for Python

# 9. Instead of building a list with a loop, one can build it more concisely with a list comprehension

# 10. Finally, Python’s special Slice Operator. It is a way to get items from lists, as well as change them
